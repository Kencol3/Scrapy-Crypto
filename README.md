# Scrapy-Crypto
My NYDSA project to Scrape data from CoinMarketCap.com and analyze the Crypto Market.
The scraped data will help us highlight those coins, which will merit in depth research.
We are essentially scraping a snapshot of the market as it stands the day the spider is launched. (Spider enclosed).
